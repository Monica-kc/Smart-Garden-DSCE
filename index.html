        <div id="para1"><h2 id="intro-name">INTRODUCTION</h2><p id="para-one"> A smart garden is a system that monitors the environment of plants. Maintaining a garden is a time-consuming and laborious effort in and of itself; on top of that, watering plants with minimal waste has become a must to reduce energy usage and conserve water. The same technology that allows us to live comfortably within our own four walls can also help us build our own private oasis of natural nourishment. This proposal proposes a smart gardening system that makes use of the Internet of Things concept (IoT). The major goal of this project is to reduce water consumption when gardening and to maintain the garden remotely. Important plant data, such as temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture, is continuously stored in a cloud-based database in this system. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based planning is carried out on a regular basis to water the plants and give appropriate lighting in the garden area for aesthetic purposes. The Blynk application is used to view sensor data from a remote location. Notification service can also be introduced with the help of the Blynk app.</p></div>

                           To teach people with little or no gardening expertise how to grow vegetables in the most efficient and resource-saving manner feasible.<br><br>
                            Our smart garden is environmentally friendly. It helps in the minimization of greenhouse impact (global warming).
                        
        <h2 id="vision_name">VISION</h2>

        <div id="para3">The Smart Garden project intends to create a product-service system with sophisticated technological and social capabilities that can govern major components of a public or private garden using the Internet of Things.
            Thanks to the development of a multi-sensor system and a cloud platform for managing the collected data, it will be possible to intervene on factors such as the health of the garden and the people who visit it, air quality,
            irrigation, lighting, atmospheric and sound pollution, and the overall sustainability of the system.</div>

             <div id="para4"><h2>OUTLOOK</h2>
                A sensible gardening method is implemented in this project.<br> Based on both ambient sensor data and soil moisture data, the system can adjust the water delivery to the plants.<br> The garden area's lighting has also been taken care of.<br>The deep-learning system has effectively managed the plant health-care department.<br> In addition, the garden can bring individuals from all over the world together, which is one of its unique selling points.<br> 
                Growing vegetables, medicinal plants, herbs, fruits, etc. at home using AI-powered machines are characteristics of an urban farmer.<br> The aim is to hyper localise food production irrespective of environmental temperature, negligible farming and gardening expertise and in less time.<br>
 The food industry will become hyper-localized and experimental. <br>
People will be able to produce exotic plants and herbs instead of buying them at expensive rates from the market.<br>
Making use of this technology in farming and gardening accessible and affordable at the grassroots level will be another groundbreaking evolution of humanity.</div>
